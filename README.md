What this does:
This app displays animated GIFs of movies, pulling from Giphy.

#How the code works:
The app uses AJAX to call the Giphy API, along with JavaScript and jQuery to display the HTML content. The styling was done with Bootstrap and standard CSS.

Click on a button to display 10 animated Giphy images from a movie clip.
The images will be still when they first appear, click on them to start the animation! 
There is also a search button - type in an artist, hit the Submit button and the new movie button will load after the originals.
The random button will product a random gif! Try it, it's fun!
